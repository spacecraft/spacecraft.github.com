    <pre>
  Hi,
  
  I would like to gauge the level of interest for a hacker / project /
  creative / maker space in Christchurch.
  
  I've been interested in the concept for quite a while but after
  spending some time in similar setups in Europe I'm even more convinced
  it would be a great addition to the city. While I could spout on about
  it having social, community, technical, educational and creative
  benefits I'm really only suggesting it because I want to be able to
  work on projects and hang out with interesting people at the same
  time.
  
  If you're not familiar with the concept here are a couple of starting
  points for learning more:
  
    <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/">http://hackerspaces.org/</a>
    <a href="http://metalab.at/wiki/English">http://metalab.at/wiki/English</a>
  
  Already I've talked about the concept with a couple of people and had
  a positive response. There is also a possibility of an at least
  temporary location in the central city. I suspect we would probably
  start off with having gatherings one or two nights a week.
  
  Please participate in the discussion forum / mailing list if you are
  interested in helping this get started or interested in participating
  once it's started:
  
    <a href="http://groups.google.co.nz/group/chchspace">http://groups.google.co.nz/group/chchspace</a>
  
  I welcome suggestions for venues, funding, participants, equipment and
  interminable discussions about a suitably local-flavoured name.
  
  Know someone who creates, hacks, crafts, makes or who might otherwise
  benefit from such a space? Please pass a link to this page along to them.
  
  Thanks for your time.
  
  --Phil.
