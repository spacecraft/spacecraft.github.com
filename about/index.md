## What is a hackerspace/makerspace?

A Makerspace, sometimes called Hackerspace, is both a physical place and a community. What binds the community together is the joy of making things. There is no limit on what “things” can mean in this context, many makerspaces have a bias towards electronics or physical computing projects but it can, and should, include working with wood, fabric, food, glass, metal, beer or projects that include all of those… anything that can be made, discussed, refined and tinkered with.

## Where is it?

At the stairs around the back of Pomeroy's Old Brewery Inn, 292 Kilmore St, Christhcurch.

## So is it just a shared workshop?

There may be an aspect of that as Makerspaces are often opportunities for makers to access resources, such as 3D printers or laser cutters, that they might not be justifiable for an individual. But Makerspaces try and establish a community of makers, to share expertise, perhaps with regular events and often a social environment that goes beyond just a simple physical presence.

## I don’t have a project, would I be welcome?

Sure, people will come to learn, to work on their own projects individually or in groups and the Foundation will likely have community projects on-going as well. If you are interested in making or in learning about making then this is the place for you.

## What is the current status of The Foundation in Christchurch?

As of mid 2014 it’s fair to say it’s “fledgling” so this is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor. So far we have, thanks to a grant, acquired three 3D printers and have been assembling them as a community project. We generally meet on a Sunday afternoon in a borrowed office and that will likely continue for a while. Ultimately we  wish to obtain a space of our own that will be available 24/7 for members, when that will be possible will depend on how fast membership grows.

## How do I find out more?

The best way is simply to come along and ask somebody, then keep asking until you find out somebody who knows. But for more information about Makerspaces in general you might find the [Hackerspace Wiki](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Hackerspaces) useful as a way to explore the diversity of Makerspaces and the sort of things that are possible.
